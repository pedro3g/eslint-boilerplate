> It is also necessary to add some settings in the Visual Studio Code (settings.json). You can find the configuration I use by [clicking here](https://gist.github.com/krelod/881e95638b6078cd51cbff383a4078fe)

## Installation of dependencies

After that, just run the command to install the NodeJS packages:
```
npm install
```
or
```

```
